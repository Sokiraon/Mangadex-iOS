# Mangadex-iOS
An unofficial iOS App for [Mangadex](mangadex.org).

## Quick start

First, make sure you have these tools installed:

- Xcode (lastest version is always preferred, of course)
- [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/#install) (for package management)

Download the code and head into the root directory, then run this command in the terminal:
```
$ pod install
```

Then, open the `Mangadex.xcworkspace` file from Xcode, and you are ready to go!
